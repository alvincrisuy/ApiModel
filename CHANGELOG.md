# Changelog

## 1.0.0

Arbitrarily bump version to 1.0.0. API is stable and it doesn't make sense to have it in production and still be on the `0.X` versioning scheme.

- Upgrade to Swift 4.2
- Upgrade to Alamofire 4.7
- Upgrade to SwiftyJSON 4.2
- Upgrade to RealmSwift 3.13

## 0.14.0

- Upgrade to Swift 4.0
- Upgrade to RealmSwift 3.0.1
- Upgrade to Alamofire 4.5
- Don't log headers by default since it might contain sensitive information

## 0.13.0

Breaking changes:

- Change Rails-style callback methods to include the response `ApiModelResponse` instance in the callback parameters. This affects:
  - Api.find
  - Api.findArray
  - Api.update
  - Api.create

This makes it possible to get the error messages from the request, but also lets the caller know more about the request.

For example, with the new parameters:

### New way

```swift
Api<Post>.find { post, response in
  if let post = post {
    print("Got post \(post.title)")
  } else if let errors = response.errorMessages {
    print("got errors: \(errors.join("\n"))")
  }
}
```

### Old way

```swift
Api<Post>.find { post in
  if let post = post {
    print("Got post \(post.title)")
  } else {
    print("error?")
  }
}
```

## 0.12.0

Breaking changes:

- Update to Realm 1.0.0 ðŸŽˆðŸŽˆðŸŽˆ

## 0.11.0

Breaking changes:

- Changed the interface for `Transform`. The `perform`-method now includes a second parameter:

```swift
func perform(value: AnyObject?, realm: Realm?) -> AnyObject?
```

This will be the Realm object that will be associated with any newly created objects. For example in `ModelTransform` or `ArrayTransform`.

Dependency upgrade:

- This release bumps Realm to version `0.98.4`, which should not break your app installs.

## 0.10.2

- Fixes #22. Code for `rootNamespace` had been broken since a bad rebase. Included tests to verify fix.

## 0.10.1

- Update to `RealmSwift 0.96.3`

## 0.10.0
Breaking changes:

- Rename `API` to `ApiManager`
- Rename `api()` to `apiManager()`
- Rename `ApiForm` to `Api`

- Upgrade `RealmSwift` to `0.96` which might be breaking for your app. [Please read the Realm blog post for more details](https://realm.io/news/realm-objc-swift-0.96.0-beta/)
- Upgrade `Alamofire` to `3.0.0` which might require upgrades of your app.
